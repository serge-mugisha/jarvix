### **[Jarvix](http://heyjarvix.com/) -- A Smart Home Assistant Development Guide**

This guide outlines the architecture, technologies, and development decisions for building a **privacy-first Google Home-like smart home assistant**. It integrates **[Zigbee](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/zigbee/)**, **[Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/)**, and **[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/)** for device communication, with an optional server setup for remote access.

----------

### **1. Key Objectives**

1.  **Privacy-First Design:**
    -   No third-party cloud servers; all processing is local.
2.  **Protocol Compatibility:**
    -   Support for Zigbee (legacy and popular devices) and Thread (future-proof IoT protocol with [Matter](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)).
3.  **Unified Communication:**
    -   Use MQTT as the base protocol for controlling devices.
4.  **Remote Access:**
    -   Provide a secure way for users to control devices outside their home network without relying on external cloud services.
5.  **Simplicity for End Users:**
    -   Minimize complexity in setup while maintaining flexibility and security.

----------

### **2. Architecture Overview**

#### **Core Components**

1.  **Base Device:**
    
    -   Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5 or Intel N100 Mini PC.
    -   Roles:
        -   Runs Zigbee and Thread integrations.
        -   Hosts an MQTT broker for device communication.
        -   Runs a lightweight HTTP/WebSocket server for remote control.
2.  **IoT Protocols:**
    
    -   **Zigbee:** Handles legacy devices via Zigbee2MQTT.
    -   **Thread:** Supports Matter-ready devices via OpenThread.
3.  **Mobile App:**
    
    -   Local: Directly communicates with the base device when on the same network.
    -   Remote: Sends requests to the base device’s server via HTTPS.
4.  **Remote Server:**
    
    -   Runs on the base device, enabling secure external communication via:
        -   HTTPS with TLS encryption.
        -   Dynamic DNS or VPN for remote connectivity.

----------

### **3. Protocol Integrations**

#### **a. Zigbee**

-   **Hardware Requirements:**
    -   Zigbee coordinator: **nRF52840 Dongle**, **ConBee II**, or **Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 Dongle**.
-   **Software:**
    -   **Zigbee2MQTT:** Translates Zigbee device communication into MQTT messages.
-   **Features:**
    -   Device discovery, state updates, and control commands via MQTT topics.

#### **b. Thread**

-   **Hardware Requirements:**
    -   Thread Border Router: **[nRF52840 Dongle](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-Dongle)**.
-   **Software:**
    -   **[OpenThread Border Router (OTBR)](https://openthread.io/):**
        -   Bridges Thread devices to the local network.
        -   Integrates with Matter for standardized device control.
-   **Features:**
    -   IPv6-based communication, scalable mesh networking.

#### **c. MQTT as the Unified Protocol**

-   Acts as the central messaging protocol for both Zigbee and Thread devices.
-   Broker: **Mosquitto**.
-   Message Flow:
    -   Devices publish state updates (e.g., `zigbee/livingroom/light/state`).
    -   Mobile app subscribes to topics for updates and publishes control commands (e.g., `zigbee/livingroom/light/set`).

----------

### **4. Remote Access Implementation**

#### **a. Key Design Decisions**

-   The base device runs a lightweight HTTP/WebSocket server to receive commands from the mobile app when the user is outside the local network.

#### **b. Server Configuration**

1.  **Framework:**
    -   **FastAPI** (Python): For a REST API and WebSocket server.
    -   WebSocket: Provides real-time updates for device states.
2.  **Security:**
    -   Use TLS for HTTPS.
    -   Implement JWT tokens for authentication.
3.  **Networking:**
    -   Dynamic DNS (e.g., DuckDNS) maps the user's public IP to a domain name.
    -   Port forwarding routes external traffic to the server.
4.  **Alternative Secure Access:**
    -   **VPN (Recommended):** Set up WireGuard for remote access without exposing ports.
    -   **Cloudflare Tunnel:** Optional for secure reverse proxying without port forwarding.

#### **c. Mobile App Integration**

-   Local Access:
    -   Connect directly to the server via its local IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`).
-   Remote Access:
    -   Connect to the public domain name (e.g., `https://myassistant.ddns.net`).

----------

### **5. Key Features of the Mobile App**

#### **Command Flow**

1.  User sends a command (e.g., "Turn on the kitchen light").
2.  Mobile app sends a REST request or publishes an MQTT message to the base device’s server.
3.  The server processes the request and sends a control message via MQTT to the relevant device.

#### **Device State Updates**

1.  Devices publish state updates to MQTT topics (e.g., `zigbee/kitchen/light/state`).
2.  The server pushes these updates to the mobile app via WebSocket.

#### **Seamless Switching:**

-   The app detects whether the user is on the local or external network and adjusts endpoints automatically.

----------

### **6. Security Best Practices**

1.  **Encryption:**
    
    -   Use TLS certificates for all external communication.
    -   Encrypt MQTT traffic between the broker and devices.
2.  **Authentication:**
    
    -   Require JWT tokens or API keys for all API requests.
    -   Optionally, use mutual TLS for client-server authentication.
3.  **Firewall Rules:**
    
    -   Restrict incoming traffic to specific ports and IPs.
    -   Use fail2ban to block brute-force attacks.
4.  **Audit Logs:**
    
    -   Maintain logs of server access and API calls for debugging and monitoring.

----------

### **7. Setup Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Base Device Setup**

1.  Install an OS:
    -   Raspberry Pi: Use **Raspberry Pi OS**.

#### **Step 4: Mobile App Development**

1.  Build the app with the ability to:
    -   Send REST requests to control devices.
    -   Receive real-time state updates via WebSocket.
